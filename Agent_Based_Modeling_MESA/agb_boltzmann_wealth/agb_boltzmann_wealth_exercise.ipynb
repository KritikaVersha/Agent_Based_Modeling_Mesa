For example, all the agents may activate in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled; we may try to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more. Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface. That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior. This may not seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your results [Comer2014].\n",

The step method is the action the agent takes when it is activated by the model schedule. We add an agent to the schedule using the add method; when we call the schedule’s step method, the model shuffles the order of the agents, then activates and executes each agent’s step method."

Both grids and continuous spaces are frequently toroidal, meaning that the edges wrap around, with cells on the right edge connected to those on the left edge, and the top to the bottom. This prevents some cells having fewer neighbors than others, or agents being able to go off the edge of the environment.\n",
